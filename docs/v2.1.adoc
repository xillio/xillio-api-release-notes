= Version 2.1 (14-11-2018)

The release of 2.1.0 came with: *Content Scripts*.
This feature allows you to execute Node.js scripts on content going through Xillio API.

This version adds three new connectors:

- OpenText
- Sitecore
- WordPress


== 2.1.26 - OpenText Connector

A new connector is released: OpenText.

== 2.1.14 - Named Queries

Named queries allow you to down-scope the amount of content to ingest. You can now define queries which are executed
by target systems when you request entities. This way you no longer have to fetch all entities and do the filtering
yourself.

== 2.1.7 - `metadata` Scope

This release introduces a new scope: `metadata`. This scope returns user-defined metadata from the target systems. For
example, when you have created custom columns in SharePoint, you can use the `metadata` scope to retrieve this.
