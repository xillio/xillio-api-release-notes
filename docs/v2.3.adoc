= Version 2.3 (current)

This version adds the Configuration Manager.

== 2.3.0 - Configuration Manager

The new Configuration Manager has been added.

The configuration manager allows users to create and manage configurations with the use of an user interface,
where they previously had to do this with more technical tools (e.g. Curl and Postman).

This manager is accessible from the browser on your desktop, tablet or mobile-device.
